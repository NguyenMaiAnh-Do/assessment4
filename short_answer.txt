1) What is the difference between a client and a server? In the HTTP protocol,
which one of these sends requests, and which one sends responses?
Client is on the front-end, rendering the page for users to user. it sends request to the back-end
Server is on the back-end, handle logic to serve client's request. it sends response to the front-end

-------------------
2) What do we mean by a "route" on a server?

route is a part of API for front-end and back-end to communite with each other

3) The steps below de describe what happens when a user goes to
a URL like https://facebook.com/home in their browser, but are out of order.
Put them in the correct order from start to finish.

- The server runs a function associated to the route /home, which produces some HTML
- The user's browser displays the HTML it recieved
- The server sends that HTML back to the user's browser as a response
- The user's browser sends a request to a Facebook server for the route /home
- The User types in https://facebook.com/home and hits enter
